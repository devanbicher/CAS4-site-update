The purpose of this file is to have a running document of the steps that I need to take when transferring a website.


########  -- CAS2 -- ##########
1. cd to the site
2. run transfermodulelist <sitename>

########  -- CAS4 -- ##########
1. go to the ~/cas2modulelists
2. run "chekmodules <name_of_site-modules-date.csv>"
3. Note modules on this list
   a.  Disable/uninstall
   b.  Modules that need to be kept for now
--------- AT this point I need a succinct way of adding modules to a list to supply to my transfer site script so that they can be disabled


########  -- CAS4 -- ##########

1. Install new website, with same name as the one to be transferred
2. add new website to the host file on my computer, ONLY WHILE TESTING

########  -- CAS2 -- ##########

1. Put cas2 theme into git
   a. initialize git in themes folder
   b. add theme, commit
   c. setup repo in gogs
   d. add remote repo, push
2. Make sure private folder is setup - for doing a backup_migrate dump
3. Perform the backup migrate dump
4. Copy files to cas4
5. Copy backup_migrate dump to cas4


########  -- CAS4 -- ##########
1. Run the transfer site script to update some stuff on the site.
2. check to make sure it is working.
